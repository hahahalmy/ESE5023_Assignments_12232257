Good job ! I shall give you a "86" for this assignment. Including a "-2" for your missing of explaining any trend in Q1.2, a "-2" for your missing of explaining how you filter in Q2, a "-10" for you may misunderstand the aims of questions in Q3.8, Q3.9, and Q3.10. (Hint: for Q3.8 `Climatology` of `dayofyear` means to calculate the average of all years for each of the sequential day, and in Q3.9: `Anomally` means using data of each day of each year minus the average of the sequantial day we calculated on Q3.8)
Here are some suggestions: Try not to show the reports with several warnings, which kind of mess up your report. Please find some useful massage to avoid or turn off the warnings. Hope the link here will be helpful. https://www.dataquest.io/blog/settingwithcopywarning/. Besides, please add more remarks to explain your logical flow in script, thanks.
